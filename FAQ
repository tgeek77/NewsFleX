_____________________THIS IS THE NewsFleX FAQ_____________________

Q:
What is NewsFleX?
A:
NewsFleX is an off line NNTP news reader for the Xwindow system.

Q:
For who is this program useful?
A:
For anyone who uses a dial up connection and has to pay by the second
for the phone line.

Q:
What do I need to  run NewsFleX?
A:
Software:
 mpack / munpack (a base 64 capable encoder / decoder).
   Mpack/munpack is available via anonymous FTP in 
   ftp.andrew.cmu.edu/pub/mpack/
 X11R6 or like that, linux as from 2.0.30.
 A viewer, like for example xv, to view pictures in binary attachments.
  Other viewers or applications if you use different attachments.  
 For encryption using PGP:
  There is encryption software (free ware) available at:
  http://www.pgpi.com/
  or
  http://www.pgp.com/
  There is a European and US version, some versions may be legal in only
  certain parts of the world.
  NewsFleX was only tested with PGP 50 i (European release).
Hardware:
 The binary is for a 486 or higher.
 At least 12 MBytes RAM and a lot of disc space.
 Facilities:
  A connection to the Internet.
  Access to an NNTP news server.

Q:
Can NewsFleX be used as a mail client?
A:
No, but NewsFleX can reply to an article via email.
Also NewsFleX can automatically start you mail reader program (like for
example popclient) when it starts dialing in.
And NewsFleX can reply to incoming mail in /var/spool/mail/user

Q:
So NewsFleX can automatically dial my provider?
A:
Yes, and automatically hang up, after it has finished.
Be VERY CAREFUL with the last option, it will also kill a FTP for
example, so if you have ANY other net program running, do not use this
option!

Q:
I have an article with a binary file attached, NewsFleX says: "no helper
program found' now what?
A:
It is saved to disk.
If the file is for example in news group alt.binary.files, then you will
find the file in:
~/.NewsFleX/newsserver/period/alt.binary.files/

Q:
I have a program with a lot of unreadable stuff, it says amongst other
things:
goody.htm
If I start the viewer, netscape starts (specified in helpers) but I get no
text and it looks like netscape hangs.
A:
This is because the goodies.htm file probably specifies some picture as an
URL.
Netscape will try to go online to get it, but if you are off line reading
the news, netscape may wait a LONG time before it reports an error.
Check /var/adm/messages to see if netscape tries to make a connection.
It will look something like:
 named[43]: ns_forw: sendto([xx.xx.xx.xx.xx): Network is unreachable
To get things working, you would have to connect to the net.
Anyways, you will find the decoded goodies.htm in:
 ~/.NewsFleX/newsserver/period/news_group/
NewsFleX has an URL list.
In an article body, if you come across an URL, mark part off the URL by
pressing the left mouse button and moving the mouse a little.
Then press the right mouse button.
You will be asked to enter a comment, so later you will know what this
URL was all about.
The URL is then stored in the URL list.
Once you have read all articles, and moved the URL's you want to access to
this list, you can select URL list from the WINDOW pull down menu.
Connect to the net, and double clicking on one of the URLS's in the URL
browser will command netscape to display the URL.
This way you can quickly check a lot of URL's you collected.

Off line web page reading:
You can mark URL's for later retrieval (and specify if you want,
to get pictures, only from that specific host, and / or get this URL daily).
Then, you can use the function GET MARKED URLS from the ONLINE
pulldown menu, and read the URL's later offline, using the build in
browser, or any specified external one, for example netscape).

Q:
NewsFleX does not fit my screen size.
A:
NewsFleX was developed for 800*600 screen size.
Now I have allowed  for rescaling, however text in buttons is not rescaled,
neither are some of the forms.
This has my attention, but I am limited by the forms library (or my
understanding of it).

Q:
Incoming articles are not always grouped together, how come?
A:
NewsFleX uses the 'official' way to test if an article is part of a thread.
If an article comes in, it tests if any existing articles message id is
present in the reference field of the new article.
If found, it puts the new article next to that one.
If the original article (the one replied to) is not there, a match is
not found, and the article is added to the end of the list.
More (other articles) may come in and also go to the end of the list.
If more people replied to that same article, no match will occur.
So there may be different little groups with the same subject.
However in this version I also check for the same subject, if the match
described above fails, the article is still put by articles with the same
subject.
 
Q:
How much disk space does NewsFleX use?
A:
Thats up to you, how much articles you keep, from time to time you should
select GROUPS then DELETE ALL NOT LOCKED ARTICLES IN ALL GROUPS.
That will clear all you did not lock, but not what you marked for retrieval,
and not what you did not read.
I do this every time after I read all articles.

Q:
Do I have to do refresh group list every time I go on line?
A:
No, only when you think new groups have been added to your news server, that
you really want.
(This may not happen as frequently as you think).
 
Q:
What about backups?
A:
Its a good idea to once in a while when everything works OK, make a backup.
backup everything from the ~/.NewsFleX/ tree.

Q:
NewsFleX is sounding the audio alarm. how do I stop it?
A:
press STOP.

Q:
What is the meaning of the (8453) numbers between parenthesis in the article
list, and in the article body display?
A:
These are the article numbers,
you will find the article headers as head.nnn and article bodies as
body.nnn in the group directory, for example:
(8453) in group alt.test refers to
~/.NewsFleX/newsserver/period/alt.test/head.8453
~/.NewsFleX/newsserver/period/alt.test/body.8453
You can view headers and bodies with any normal editor, BUT DO NOT EDIT
HEADERS and BODIES!
You can also view headers by double clicking the right mouse button in the
article list or posting list.
Postings also have numbers, for head, body, attachment, custom_header,
Posting files are in ~/.NewsFleX/postings/period/

Q: 
I see debug in the option pull down menu, what does it do?
A:
It prints to stdout (almost all) function calls and there arguments, plus
some additional information.
If you want to debug, start NewsFleX with:
NewsFleX -shared > debug_file.
Then while in NewsFleX, before you do what you want to debug, activate the
debug option.
Or, if you want to debug everything, start NewsFleX like this:
NewsFleX -debug -shared > debug_file.
After you did what you wanted to debug, disable the debug option.
You will find the data in debug_file.
Note: This file can become VERY long (megabytes) so use the debug option
selective.
 
Q:
I found this bug, now what.
A:
Start NewsFleX like this:
NewsFleX -shared > debug_file
Then, just before the situation where you know the bug is:
Select OPTIONS then DEBUG
Do what you did to get the bug (it does not matter if the program crashes).
Mail report to:
newsflex@panteltje.demon.nl (Jan Mourer), and I will try to fix it.
Please include a short description of the bug, and the last say 20 lines of
debug_file.

Q:
What are the future plans with NewsFleX?
A:
No idea.
Now working on improvement and new features.
These will be realized as time goes by.

Q.
How do I get maximum speed?
A.
From the OPTIONS pull down menu select SETUP.
Press 'Insert headers' OFLINE button.
Press 'Get bodies by' MSG ID button.

Q.
How do I get minimum online (phone) cost?
A.
From the OPTIONS pull down menu select SETUP.
Press Auto connect to net button. (only use as root)
Press Auto disconnect from net button. (only use as root)
For the last 2 buttons you must be root, these start the connect script
and disconnect script.
Make sure you got the right scripts. 
And specify the full pathnames.

Q.
What is the mail script in setup, how do I use that:
A:
Get mail script input field:
This will execute a file after NewsFleX has connected to the net (blue
button), and before it gets news.
It is intended for a script that read mail from a mail server.
The field requires the full pathname, so do not just type popclient ...
there.
Typing /pathto/popclient arg arg arg will not work either, that will confuse
popclient.
Make a script for example get_my_mail, put the call to popclient in it,
then enter the pathname to the script in the execute program input field.
So the script could simply contain:
popclient
(if you had your name and password in .poprc)
If the script is named get_my_mail and resides in /usr/local/bin then
enter /usr/local/bin/get_my_mail in the 'Get mail script' input field.
Now mail will be transferred from your pop server every time NewsFleX connects
to the ISP.

Q.
Where do I find NewsFleX?
A.
NewsFleX has its home at:
http://www.panteltje.demon.nl/newsflex/
Any announcements will be made here, and in the news groups
alt.usenet.offline-reader, and news.software.readers.

NewsFleX has many more features, and new ones are being added all the time.
Do a man NewsFleX, and find out about the latest goodies in your version.
