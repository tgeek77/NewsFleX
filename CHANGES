Changes from 1.0.6:
Long references lines are now trimmed according to rfc1036-new-draft.
This implies the 6th entry is removed, the last 9 entries will be left
present.
I have also limited the maximum number of entries to less then 20.
Header lines are folded if longer then about 800 bytes.

Changes from 1.1.9.3:
operations on multi line entries in posting editor now work for all lines,
not only the first line.
Host only in get URL now will work if server specifies same URL by accident.

Changes from 1.1.9.4:
'Beep on mail' button in setup form:
If this button is pressed then NewsFleX will beep 2 times if new mail arrives
and the 'Check mail' button was also pressed.
 
Alt editor in posting form used to crash sometimes.
Added a lot of checks in do_alt_editor() in postings.c.
Also disabled all forms in that routine, so no user action can change
any parameters.
Wait and see if OK now.

Posting wrap input field in posting editor added, a global variable that
determines where the word wrap in the posting editor takes place.

You can now enable an automatic line in replies to articles via news and
mail, by pressing the button in the setup form next to the 'posting source'
input field.
In this input field, the macros $D (date) and $N (name) will be replaced by 
the date the original message had, and the name of the original poster.
The expanded macro line will appear at the top of your reply, followed
by an empty line.
